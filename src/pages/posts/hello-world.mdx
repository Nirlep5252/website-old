## Inspiration
<hr />

I was first inspired to learn [Astro.build](https://astro.build) from the YouTube video of [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsTXcSeAZq8) about it. The design and idea behind this website is inspired from the blog of [Alberto](https://halb.it/).
<br /><br />

## Why Astro?
<hr />

The reason why I chose Astro for my blog is because it is really fast static site generator. I also wanted to try out a new framework, and Astro seemed like a good choice.
<br />

Also, I can publish blogs quickly with Astro as I can use Markdown for writing blogs. I can also use React, Vue, Svelte and other components in my blogs. It also has it's own component system which is really cool.
<br />

I finished making this website in only a few hours and my experience with Astro was flawless, I liked it a lot. I highly recommend you to try it out.

## That's it!
<hr />

I hope you liked my first blog post. I will be posting more blogs in the future. If you have any suggestions, please let me know in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/9rYbc54KtY) server.
